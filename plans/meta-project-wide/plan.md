# Meta (Project-wide) Plan

## Requirements Snapshot
| Requirement | Status | Planned Actions |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Portability | [ ] | Define minimum supported platforms, document capability fallbacks, add CI coverage for representative targets, and codify support tiers. |
| Performance guarantees | [ ] | Establish performance budgets for core collections and concurrency primitives; document expected complexity, benchmarking cadence, and regression thresholds. |
| Safety guarantees | [ ] | Formalize safety story, delineating safe vs. unsafe APIs, verifying invariants through tooling, and publishing safety audits. |
| Extensibility | [x] | Traits/interfaces enable user extensions today. | Continue maintaining open extension points, document best practices, and require API stability reviews. |
| Release governance | [ ] | Need versioning policy and LTS cadence. | Draft semantic versioning policy, release notes template, and backport criteria. |

## Near-Term Tasks
- **Produce project charter** detailing portability, performance, and safety goals with measurable metrics.
- **Integrate requirements tracking** into roadmap tooling referencing other plan documents.
- **Schedule periodic reviews** to reassess meta requirements alongside shipped features.
- **Draft release governance RFC** covering versioning, branching, and backport workflows.
- **Define KPI dashboard** capturing performance budgets and safety audit status.

## Milestones
- **M1 — Charter Ratification (2 weeks):** finalize charter, circulate for sign-off, publish in `docs/`.
- **M2 — Governance Toolkit (3 weeks):** roadmap tooling integration, versioning policy, review cadences documented.
- **M3 — Metrics Dashboard (2 weeks):** automated collection of coverage, performance, and safety KPIs with weekly reporting.

## Dependencies
- Platform support work from `plans/os-and-platform/plan.md`.
- Trait and generic infrastructure from `plans/tier-1-core-language-semantics/plan.md`.

## Pseudocode and Complexity

### Governance Review Cycle
```pn
run_governance_cycle :: (quarter: Quarter) -> none => {
	agenda := collect_agenda_items(quarter)
	metrics := fetch_dashboard_metrics()
	meeting := schedule_review(agenda)
	decisions := conduct_review(meeting, metrics)
	publish_minutes(decisions)
	track_action_items(decisions.action_items)
}
```
- **Time:** O(A + M) where A agenda items, M metrics collected.
- **Space:** O(A) for agenda storage plus O(I) action items backlog.
