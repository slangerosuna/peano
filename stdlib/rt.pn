# Peano runtime scaffolding
# Eventually this file will implement _start and allocator hooks in peano itself.

# Signal to the compiler that runtime entry may be requested
Runtime := { }

# Expose start as a normal function for now; the Rust host will map it to _start when runtime mode is enabled
start :: () -> i32 => { main(); 0 }
